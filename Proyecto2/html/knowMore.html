    <h1 id="start">Role-Playing Games</h1>
    <p>
      A <em><abbr title="Sometimes spelled 'roleplaying game' or 'RPG'">Role-playing game</abbr></em> is a game in which
      <mark>players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting</mark>. Players
      <strong
        >take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured
        decision-making regarding character development</strong
      >. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>There are several forms of role-playing games:</p>
    <dt>Original form:</dt>
    <dd>Sometimes called the <abbr title="Tabletop Role-Playing Game">TRPG</abbr>, is conducted through discussion</dd>
    <dt>Live action role-playing:</dt>
    <dd>LARP, players physically perform their characters actions.</dd>
    <p>
      In both of these forms, an arranger called a <abbr title="Game Master">GM</abbr> usually decides on the rules and setting to be used, while
      acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character.
    </p>
    <p>Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplayer Text-Based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).</li>
      <li>Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs).</li>
      <li>Trading/Collectible Card Games (CCGs).</li>
      <li>Wargames</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The term role-playing game is also sometimes used to describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching, training, and
      academic research.

          The concept of the <abbr title="Pocket Monsters">Pokémon</abbr> universe stems from the hobby of <strong>insect collecting</strong>, a
          popular pastime which <abbr title="Pokemon creator">Tajiri</abbr> enjoyed as a child. Players are designated as
          <em>Pokémon Trainers</em> and have three general goals:
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              To complete the <strong>regional <em>Pokédex</em></strong> by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional

          Undertale is a <strong>2015 2D role-playing video game</strong> created by American indie developer <strong>Toby Fox</strong>. The player
          controls a child who has <mark>fallen into the Underground</mark>: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, separated by a
          magical barrier. The player <strong>meets various monsters</strong> during the journey back to the surface, although some monsters might
          <strong>engage the player in a fight</strong>. The combat system involves the player navigating through <em>mini-bullet hell attacks</em> by
          the opponent. They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them. These choices affect the game, with
          the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.
